# Mine-detection-from-Sonar-Data-using-Multilayer-Feedforward-Perceptrons-and-Logistic-Regression-tech
The task is to train a model to discriminate between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock. Used Multilayer Feedforward Perceptrons and Logistic Regression to find the lowest misclassification error, perfect Sensitivity and Specificity.
